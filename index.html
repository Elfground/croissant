    <p>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
    It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.<br />
    Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating.<br />
    The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
